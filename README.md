# Cyan v2 (WIP)

***v2 is currently under early development and is not usable! please use [v1.2](https://github.com/rodlie/cyan/tree/1.2). This is a spare-time project so development will be slow! I will not respond to v2 issues until beta status***

Cyan v2 aims be a simple open source cross-platform general-purpose image editor based on [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org).
