Cyan was an prepress color converter (and [GIMP](https://gimp.org) plug-in) but now aims to be a general-purpose image editor based on [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org).

***Currently under early development, not usable yet! please use [v1.2](https://github.com/rodlie/cyan/tree/1.2).***

***You can track development on our [ChangeLog](https://cyan.fxarena.net/ChangeLog).***

## Build

### Requirements

 * Qt5 *(Widgets/Concurrent) 5.5+*
 * Little CMS 2
 * ImageMagick *(Magick++) 7.0.8+*
   * Minimum quantum depth of 16 is recommended
   * Zero configuration is recommended
   * HDRI required
   * lcms2 required
   * png/tiff/jpeg support as a minimum
 * fontconfig *(Windows/macOS)*
 * ffmpeg *3.x+ (optional)*

### RHEL/CentOS/Fedora

On RHEL/CentOS/Fedora you will need to install the following packages:

```
sudo yum install git gcc-c++ autoconf libpng-devel libjpeg-turbo-devel lcms2-devel OpenEXR-devel libwebp-devel pango-devel cairo-devel libtiff-devel xz-devel zlib-devel qt5-qtbase-devel cmake3
```

***Remember to replace ``cmake`` with ``cmake3`` on RHEL/CentOS when running the build command further down.***

### Ubuntu Xenial/Bionic

On Ubuntu you will need to install the following packages:

```
sudo apt-get install git build-essential cmake pkg-config qtbase5-dev libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev libwebp-dev liblcms2-dev libopenexr-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev liblzma-dev zlib1g-dev libopenjp2-7-dev
```

* **Qt5 shipped with Ubuntu Bionic and beyond has issues, not recommended!**

### Other distros

If your system has an up-to-date installation of ImageMagick v7 then you only need ``qtbase`` and  ``lcms2``.

### Build Cyan

Now you can build Cyan, this command will also build and link a static version of ImageMagick.
```
git clone https://github.com/rodlie/cyan
cd cyan
git submodule update --init
MKJOBS=4 STATIC=1 sh share/scripts/build-magick.sh
mkdir build && cd build
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=`pwd`/../ImageMagick/install/lib/pkgconfig cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DMAGICK_PKG_CONFIG=Magick++-7.Q16HDRI ..
make -j4
```

A more generic example:

```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DMAGICK_PKG_CONFIG=Magick++-7.Q16HDRI <cyan_source_directory>
make -jX
sudo make install
```
