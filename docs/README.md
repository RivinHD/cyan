# Cyan

Cyan is an open source cross-platform image viewer and converter, designed for [prepress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepress) (print) work. Like converting an image from [RGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model) to [CMYK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK_color_model), or the other way around. Cyan supports [color profiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_profile) complying with the [International Color Consortium](http://www.color.org/index.xalter) (ICC) standard, and strives to create as color-accurate images as possible, with support for [RGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model), [CMYK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK_color_model) and [GRAY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayscale) with up to [32-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/32-bit) image depth.
